            <p style="text-align:center">Future orientation means <strong>creating a road map</strong> for your future, <strong>understanding how today's <br> actions impact your goals</strong>, and frequently <strong>checking your progress.</strong> <br><br>
                It is the image individuals have about their future, as consciously represented and self-reported.<br> Like autobiography, it tells a personal subjective life story consisting of those life domains  <br>individuals deem important, and gives meaning to oneâ€™s life. 
                <br><br>Being a future-oriented person allows you to plan ahead. Since planning is a crucial part of every project,<br> focusing on the future clearly helps you in achieving your goals. You can mentally visualize every<br> step of the process, predict possible obstacles and envision your success. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_orientation" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more details.
